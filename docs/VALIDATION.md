# Validation scope

Initial Capital base: `e9bea122102b87a1f11ac673d50e01c31cba6922` (README only; no pre-existing test or workflow gates).
Protocol reference: `7481b0e16ce9b903abbffa62249bb91cd9e63cfe`.

Existing coverage was inspected first: Protocol `test_mock_credit.py` covers face arithmetic, snapshots, product/real-funds refusal, reservation release; retained byte-for-byte and rerun. Existing `test_credit_fsm.py` documents lifecycle, terminal, shared face, settlement and replay behavior. Capital does not claim those historic runs as its own evidence.

New coverage addresses the absent application layer: `tests/test_capital.py` tests full facade lifecycle, immutable views, duplicate/conflicting first receipts, two-thread shared face contention, lost-response lookup, absent outcome UNKNOWN, old session, strict input, malformed/duplicate JSON, Unicode regression, host/Origin/CSRF, capacity, exact vendor hashes and replay. `tests/browser/journey.spec.cjs` tests actual UI normal/negative journeys, response loss before/after apply, reload fencing, GET-only recovery, keyboard order, mobile overflow and desktop/mobile screenshots.

Commands and initial actual results: Python facade/API 19 passed; pinned MockCredit 7 passed; JS syntax passed. Initial Chromium browser suite: 6 passed; desktop/mobile screenshots inspected. Exact-head CI is reported in PR evidence after their actual runs. A sandbox initially blocked loopback bind; the same test suite passed when local bind permission was available. This is not a product test failure masked by a skip.

No production DB/Supabase/Docker is needed or accessed. No external provider call, money movement, personal financial data, token issuance or deployment. No durability, cross-host fencing, bank exactly-once, credit validity, legal compliance, authenticated export, large-scale throughput or full blueprint completion is inferred. Required independent architecture/financial decisions and human product acceptance remain pending.

## Independent-review repair

A non-author reviewer inspected implementation `6c7a064cb378f9bebea8e5cc7da5c2d1c467f8cc` and ran 19 facade/API plus 7 pinned regressions. The reviewer reproduced a P1: a delayed receipt lookup in one tab could erase a later UNKNOWN request from another tab. The repair takes the same Web Lock for command, recovery and old-session acknowledgment and compares instance + operation identity before deleting pending state. Browser regression delays the first recovery, blocks the second tab, then verifies the next UNKNOWN remains shared by both tabs. Accepted receipt validation now requires the actual F04 result/case and reconcile match, rather than only a successful envelope. Four additional browser tests cover malformed accepted response, two-tab recovery, old-process acknowledgment and unavailable storage. Local Chromium suite: **11 passed**. Deeply nested JSON now produces INVALID_JSON rather than disconnecting.

Final independent exact-HEAD review and CI are recorded in the PR after the repair commit. The earlier green CI/review does not apply to the repaired commit automatically. The reviewer is a separate Codex agent with source context, not a clean-room implementation or external Fable/A3 provider. No new external audit provider received private source.
