# Validation scope

Initial Capital base: `e9bea122102b87a1f11ac673d50e01c31cba6922` (README only; no pre-existing test or workflow gates).
Protocol reference: `7481b0e16ce9b903abbffa62249bb91cd9e63cfe`.

Existing coverage was inspected first: Protocol `test_mock_credit.py` covers face arithmetic, snapshots, product/real-funds refusal, reservation release; retained byte-for-byte and rerun. Existing `test_credit_fsm.py` documents lifecycle, terminal, shared face, settlement and replay behavior. Capital does not claim those historic runs as its own evidence.

New coverage addresses the absent application layer: `tests/test_capital.py` tests full facade lifecycle, immutable views, duplicate/conflicting first receipts, two-thread shared face contention, lost-response lookup, absent outcome UNKNOWN, old session, strict input, malformed/duplicate JSON, Unicode regression, host/Origin/CSRF, capacity, exact vendor hashes and replay. `tests/browser/journey.spec.cjs` tests actual UI normal/negative journeys, response loss before/after apply, reload fencing, GET-only recovery, keyboard order, mobile overflow and desktop/mobile screenshots.

Commands and initial actual results: Python facade/API 19 passed; pinned MockCredit 7 passed; JS syntax passed. Initial Chromium browser suite: 6 passed; desktop/mobile screenshots inspected. Exact-head CI is reported in PR evidence after their actual runs. A sandbox initially blocked loopback bind; the same test suite passed when local bind permission was available. This is not a product test failure masked by a skip.

No production DB/Supabase/Docker is needed or accessed. No external provider call, money movement, personal financial data, token issuance or deployment. No durability, cross-host fencing, bank exactly-once, credit validity, legal compliance, authenticated export, large-scale throughput or full blueprint completion is inferred. Required independent architecture/financial decisions and human product acceptance remain pending.
